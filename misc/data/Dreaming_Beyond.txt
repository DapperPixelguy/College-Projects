(Style: Romantic Imagery)
Beneath the skies, a velvet sea,
Where starlight dances wild and free,
The dreamerâ€™s heart begins its flight,
A symphony of endless night.

Mountains rise with ancient grace,
Clouds embrace their stony face.
The air hums soft with cosmic lore,
Each whisper hints of worlds and more.

Through gilded gates of slumber's keep,
The mind ascends while bodies sleep.
And every star becomes a guide,
To realms where hopes and truths collide.

Oh, to wander without fear,
Among the heavens, bright and clear.
For dreams, like stars, are never far,
And every soul contains a star.
