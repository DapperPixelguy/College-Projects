(Style: Narrative and Mythic)
Once, they said, the forest spoke,
In words of wind and ancient oak.
Its roots ran deep, its secrets vast,
A bridge between the present and past.

The villagers feared its shadowed glen,
Whispering tales of vanished men.
Yet children claimed, in voices hushed,
The trees would sing when the daylight crushed.

One eve, a wanderer sought its heart,
Drawn to its depths by some strange art.
Through paths of moss and fern he roamed,
Until he found the forest’s throne.

A tree stood tall, its bark aglow,
With leaves that shimmered like fallen snow.
It spoke no words, yet he understood—
The forest was neither evil nor good.

It simply was, as life must be,
A mirror of humanity.
The wanderer wept, his fear undone,
And left the glen with the rising sun.
