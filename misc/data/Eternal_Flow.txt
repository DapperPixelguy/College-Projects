(Style: Minimalist and Reflective)
A river moves.
No rush, no sound—
just the pulse of being.

Each drop, a memory,
each bend, a choice.
It carries all,
yet holds nothing.

The banks remain,
silent witnesses to time’s hands.
The water forgets
even as it flows.

Where does it end?
The sea, the air, the rain—
The river returns,
but it is never the same.
